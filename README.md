# Tenant UI
This serves as a dashboard that gives a top-down summary of what is taking place in the network by using a [blockscout database](https://lookout.qluv.io/txs). 
The project utilizes [Vue3.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/) and is a great starting point for anyone looking to get started with Vue.
