# Tenant UI
This serves as a dashboard that gives a top-down summary of what is taking place in the network by using a [blockscout database](https://lookout.qluv.io/txs). 
The project utilizes [Vue3.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/) and is a great starting point for anyone looking to get started with Vue.

## Files
All the code is under the `client` directory and the `server` directory is mainly to utilize a locally hosted blockscout db (ideally this would be hosted elsewhere). 

## Installation
### Client Installation
To setup the project 
```
npm install
```

This should take care of installing all the necessary packages. 
You may find that `vue-cli` is not installed. For this find the installation at [cli.vuejs.org](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html) or TL;DR is 
``` 
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
